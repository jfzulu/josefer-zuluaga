### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Jose
#### Student of software engineer

I am in the last year of my career as a software engineer. I study at the Pontifical Javeriana University. I am more and more interested with software development and its implications. I consider myself a person who learns by doing, and I know that my path in the world of development and programming is just beginning.

Skills: JAVA / C++ / JS
